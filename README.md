# guess-the-number
This program generates a random integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and prompts the user to guess the number..
It uses a while loop to repeated ask the user to guess again until they guess correctly. It also gives the user a hint each time by telling them if their incorrect guess is too low or too high.
